# Cubism

Cubism is a JavaScript library for visualizing time series data, letting you
construct beautiful real-time dashboards quickly and easily. Cubism fetches
metrics from a variety of backends and constructs dynamic visualizations in the
client using [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/).

Cubism currently supports the following backends:

  * [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/)
  * [Cube](http://square.github.com/cube/)

Cubism currently supports the following visualization types:

  * [horizon charts](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/horizon/)
